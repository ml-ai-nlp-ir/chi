### CHI â€“ A high-level framework for advanced deep learning with TensorFlow

Chi provides high-level operations for writing and visualizing experiments, defining models and running TensorFlow graphs.

--------------------------


### Guiding principles

- __No boilerplate.__ Minimize the amount of overhead when writing [experiment scripts](examples/experiments.py), defining [models](examples/models.py) or running arbitrary [TensorFlow graphs](examples/functions.py).

- __Flexibility.__ Models can be arbitrary functions and multiple models can be trained at the same time with respect to each other. That makes it easy to implement actor-critic systems or adversarial training.

- __Compliance.__ Everything is built and compliant with standard TensorFlow mechanisms such as *scopes*, *collections* and the *[keras layers API](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/contrib.layers)*.

- __Separate models and algorithms.__


---------------------------

### Getting started


__Building and Running TensorFlow Graphs__. This is done in one step by writing a normal graph builder function and wrapping it with `chi.function`:

```python
@chi.function
def my_tf_fun(x, y):
  z = tf.nn.relu(x) * y
  return z
```

That automatically builds the graph and creates placeholders for x and y. To compute `z` just call `my_tf_fun(3, 5)  # returns 15.0 `. It is also possible to specify shape and dtype of the parameters. See [examples/functions.py for more](examples/functions.py).

<br>

__Defining Models__ works similarly, except that the builder function remains a builder function that automatically shares weights.

```python
@chi.model
def my_digit_classifier(x: (None, 28*28)):  # specifies shape as (None, 28*28)
  x = layers.fully_connected(x, 100)
  z = layers.fully_connected(x, 10, None)
  p = layers.softmax(z)
  return z, p
```


See [examples/models.py for the full example (classifying hand-written digits)](examples/models.py).

<br>

__Experiment Scripts__ can also be defined via decorator. When run from the command line the function arguments are translated into command line parameters.
```python
@chi.experiment
def my_experiment(logdir, a=0.5):
  print(logdir)
  ...
```
If no logdir is specified it will generate a new one. See [examples/experiments.py for the full example](examples/experiments.py)

For a more interesting experiment see the [Wasserstein GAN example](/examples/wgan.py).

### Visualization with CHIBOARD
Chiboard is a browser based dashboard for managing experiments. Start it with `chiboard`.

Clicking on an experiment card leads to a detail page about that experiment which automatically spins up and embeds a TensorBoard:

### Installation

Requires Python 3.6

```
git clone git@github.com:rmst/chi.git
pip install -e chi
```
